                                          ---------------------

Q.1  What is OOP? List OOP concepts.
     
Ans.-->OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming language,the main purpose of oop is to deal with real-                    
            world entity using programming language.


                              The main aim of oop is bind together the data and the function that operate on 
         them,so that no other part of code can access this data except that function. 

  There are some basic concept of oops-->
          
  1.Object:-->Smallest entity of program is called object.In other words, an object can be defined as an that           
                 has a state and behaviour or anything that exists physically in the world is called object.
               e.g.- person, dog, table,city,chair,name etc.


  2. Class:-->Storing the object's property(data member) and its behaviour is called class.It is basically a 
                collection of objects.
              e.g.- assume fruits is a class and it collects the object like banana,grapes, orange etc.
s
  3. Inheritance:--> When one class access the property of another class is called inheritance.Or we can say
                      it is process in which two classes have relationship among each other.
                       e.g.- Class vehicle is the parent class and class bus,car bike etc. are the child 
                              classes.
                     
                      There are 5 types of inheritance-
                       a) Single inheritance
                       b) Mutilevel inheritance
                       c) Mutiple inheritance
                       d) Herarchical inheritance
                       e) Hybrid inheritance

   4.Polymorphism:--> When one task is performed by different ways are called polymorphism.
                       e.g.- shapes is one task but we can perform it  in many ways circle,rectangle,triangle 
                          etc.
                      There are 2 types of polymorphism-

                              1. Compile time polymorphism-
                                   a)function overloading
                                   b)operator overloading

                              2. Run time polymorphism-
                                   virtual function

   5.Encapsulation:--> Binding(or wrapping) data and functions together into a single unit is known as 
                         encapsulation.It can be achieved by making the data member's scope private and
                         the member function's scope publis to access these data members.


  6. Abstraction:-->  It helps in the data-hiding process. It also helps in displaying the essential features
                       without showing the details or the functionality to the user.It avoids unnecessary 
                       information and show only that specific part that the user wants to see.

Q.3)  Difference between oop and pops?
Ans->            
                     OOPS                                       POPS                                       
          
   1.  OOP refers to Object Oriented Programming. |  1. POP refers to the Procedural Oriented Programming.

   2.  OOP deals with object and their properties |  2.  POP deals with programs and functions.

   3.  It is highly secured.                      |  3.  It is less secure.
                       
   4.  It follows bottom-up approach.             |  4.  It follows top-down approach.

   5.  It takes more memory than pops.            |  5.  It takes very less memory.

   6.  It have access specifier like public,      |  6.  There is no any accesss specifier.
        private,protected.                       
                                           
   7.  In oops overlaoding is possible.           |  7. In pop we can't perform overloading.                                
                                               
   8.  Data hiding is possible.                   |  8.  Data hiding is not possible.

   9. Program is divided ino small parts called   |  9.Program is divided into small parts
          object.                                           called function.
 
   10. Example of oops->                          |  10. Example of pops->
                    c++,Java,Python etc.                        C, FORTRAN,COBOL etc.
